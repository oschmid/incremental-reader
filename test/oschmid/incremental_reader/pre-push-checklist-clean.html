<h1>Pre-Push Checklist</h1>
<p>March 16, 2021 &nbsp;-&nbsp; <span>3 min read</span></p>
<p>Last week I made two commits that broke really obvious things. I was rushing and thought to myself “This is a simple change. Let’s just check it in.” I should have realized that these are every developer’s famous last words…</p>
<p>After these two incidents happened so close to each other, I knew I needed a way to remind myself to be more careful. To sanity check my changes for things the Continuous Integration build might miss.</p>
<h2>Checklist for Pushing Code</h2>
<ol>
 <li>Rebase, build, and run tests (it’s quicker to run these locally rather than wait for CI build to fail)</li>
 <li>Sanity test changes 
  <ol>
   <li>Check that the app still starts</li>
   <li>Do a basic manual end-to-end sanity test to show your changes work</li>
   <li>Check the functionality <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/127467/Opinion_A_Precommit_Checklist.php">around your change</a> still works.</li>
  </ol></li>
 <li>Review the list of files in each commit (<code>git log --stat</code>) 
  <ol>
   <li>Are all necessary files included?</li>
   <li>Are any files included that shouldn't be?</li>
  </ol></li>
 <li>Read through the diff(s) 
  <ol>
   <li>Are there any unfinished sections?</li>
   <li>Are there any sections that you meant to refactor?</li>
   <li>Is each change in a commit related? (e.g. <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Interactive-Staging">separate</a> incidental code cleanups from feature/bug changes for clarity.)</li>
   <li>Do you want to reword the change description? (Remember it should have an <a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">imperative header, and a body describing what and why</a>)</li>
  </ol></li>
 <li>Update relevant documentation</li>
</ol>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://dev.to/victoria/an-automatic-interactive-pre-commit-checklist-in-the-style-of-infomercials-14i7">Victoria Drake</a> I turned this list into a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks">git hook</a>. Copy the following shell script into <code>.git/hooks</code> and name it <code>pre-push</code>.</p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh

git log origin..HEAD

# Read user input, assign stdin to keyboard
exec &lt; /dev/tty

D="\e[37m" # default
H="\e[39m" # highlight
S="\e[33m" #section

CL=$(cat &lt;&lt;-EOM

${S}Checklist${D}

1 Rebase, build, and unit test
2 App still ${H}starts${D}?
3 ${H}Sanity$D test change
4 Functionality ${H}around$D your change still works?
5 Commit includes ${H}all/only$D necessary files?
6 Review ${H}diffs$D for TODOs and refactors?
7 Is each change in a commit ${H}related${D}?

)
echo "$CL"

while read yn; do
case $yn in
Y|y|"") break;;
N|n) exit 1;;
*) echo "Please answer y (yes) or n (no):" &amp;&amp; continue;
esac
done

exec &lt;&amp;-
    </pre>
<p>Some notable features:</p>
<ul>
 <li>First it prints the <code>git log</code> of the commits to be pushed.</li>
 <li>The most meaningful word in each check is highlighted to make the list quicker to read.</li>
 <li>It only asks once whether to continue with the push, rather than after each check.</li>
 <li><code>Enter</code> will default to yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it! Let me know if you have a similar checklist process. Especially if it has something you think it has something I should add to mine!</p> <a>Comment</a>
